Next, J1 is selected as it gives more profit compared to J4.

In the next clock, J4 cannot be selected as its deadline is over, hence J3 is selected as it executes within its deadline.

The job J5 is discarded as it cannot be executed within its deadline.
Thus, the solution is the sequence of jobs (J2, J1, J3), which are being executed within their deadline and gives maximum profit.

Total profit of this sequence is 100 + 60 + 20 = 180
